# Moodlight2

Moodlight 2 is a new version of moodlight made for one ESP8266 controller. Instead of using one Arduino/Teensy controller to play the animations and one ESP8266 for internet connectivity now only one ESP8266 is used. Needed some changes to codebase and libraries.

Additonally OTA update capabilities were added and a wifi manager.
